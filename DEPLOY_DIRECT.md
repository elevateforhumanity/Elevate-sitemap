# Deploy Directly (Skip Blueprint)

## Option 1: Deploy Static Site Only (2 minutes)

### On Render Dashboard:
1. Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"
2. Connect your GitHub: `elevateforhumanity/Elevate-sitemap`
3. Configure:
   - **Name:** elevate-site
   - **Region:** Oregon
   - **Branch:** main
   - **Root Directory:** (leave blank)
   - **Runtime:** Node
   - **Build Command:** `npm install express`
   - **Start Command:** `node server-simple.js`
   - **Plan:** Free

4. Click "Create Web Service"

**Your site will be live in 2 minutes at the URL Render gives you.**

## Option 2: Use Netlify Instead (30 seconds)

Forget Render. Use Netlify:

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login
netlify deploy --prod --dir=pages
```

Done. Your site is live.

## Option 3: Use Vercel (30 seconds)

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
# Select: pages/ as the directory
```

Done. Your site is live.

## My Recommendation: Netlify

Render is being difficult with the blueprint. Netlify will have your site live in 30 seconds with zero configuration issues.
