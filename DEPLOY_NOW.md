## Which Should You Choose?

### Choose Render if:
- ✅ You want everything in one place
- ✅ You want it to "just work"
- ✅ You don't want to manage multiple services

### Choose Railway + Cloudflare if:
- ✅ You want separate backend/frontend
- ✅ You want Cloudflare's CDN
- ✅ You're okay with two platforms

### Choose Netlify if:
- ✅ You want the absolute fastest deployment
- ✅ You only care about the static pages
- ✅ Backend can wait

## My Recommendation: Render

**Why:** One command, everything works, free tier, PostgreSQL included.

**Do this now:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to Render"
git push origin main
```

Then go to render.com and click "New Blueprint" → Connect repo → Apply.

**Your site will be live in 5 minutes.**
