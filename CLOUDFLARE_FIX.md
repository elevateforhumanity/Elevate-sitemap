# Fix Cloudflare Access Issue

## 🚨 Problem
Your Cloudflare Workers domain has Access enabled:
- Domain: `*-golive.elevateforhumanity.workers.dev`
- Status: Requires authentication
- Result: Public users CANNOT access your site

## ✅ Solution: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (Not Workers)

### Option 1: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (Recommended)

Cloudflare Pages is for **static sites** and doesn't require Access authentication.

**Steps:**
1. Go to [https://dash.cloudflare.com/](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Click **Workers & Pages** → **Create Application** → **Pages** tab
3. Click **Connect to Git**
4. Select repository: `elevateforhumanity/Elevate-sitemap`
5. Configure:
   - **Project name:** `elevateforhumanity`
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory:** `dist`
6. Click **Save and Deploy**

**Result:**
- Live URL: `https://elevateforhumanity.pages.dev`
- **NO authentication required**
- Public access for everyone
- Auto-deploys on every push to `main`

### Option 2: Disable Access on Workers (Not Recommended)

If you want to keep using Workers:

1. Go to [https://dash.cloudflare.com/](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Navigate to **Zero Trust** → **Access** → **Applications**
3. Find the policy for `*-golive.elevateforhumanity.workers.dev`
4. Click **Edit** or **Delete**
5. Remove the Access policy

**Warning:** Workers are meant for backend APIs, not static sites. Pages is better for your use case.

Wrangler is only needed for:
- Cloudflare Workers (backend APIs)

- Advanced configurations

For Cloudflare Pages:
- ✅ Use GitHub integration (automatic)
- ✅ No CLI needed
- ✅ No wrangler configuration needed
- ✅ Just push to GitHub and it deploys
