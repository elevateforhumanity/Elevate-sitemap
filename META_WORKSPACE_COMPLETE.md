## ⚠️ Known Issues

### 1. React Version Peer Dependency Warning
```
react-helmet-async 2.0.5 expects React ^16.6.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0
Found: React 19.1.1
```

**Impact:** Low - React 19 is backward compatible  
**Action:** No action needed, warning can be ignored

### 2. All Repos Use Same Package Name
```
All three repositories: efh-autopilot v2.0.0
```

**Impact:** Low - They're in separate directories  
**Recommendation:** Consider unique package names for clarity

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ All repositories cloned
2. ✅ Dependencies installed
3. ✅ Workspace configured

### Development
1. Run `pnpm dev` to start all applications
2. Access LMS at http://localhost:8080
3. Access Marketing at http://localhost:5173
4. Make changes in any repository
5. Test integration between apps

### Deployment

## 📝 Important Notes

### Git Management
- Each cloned repo maintains its own git history
- Changes should be committed to individual repos
- The meta-workspace itself tracks only configuration files
- Cloned repos are in .gitignore

### Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Make changes in any app
cd apps/lms
# ... make changes ...

# 2. Commit to that repo
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push

# 3. Return to meta-workspace
cd ../..

# 4. Continue development
pnpm dev
```

### Shared Package Usage
```javascript
// In apps/lms or apps/marketing
import { Button } from '@elevate/shared';
import { formatDate } from '@elevate/shared/utils';
```
